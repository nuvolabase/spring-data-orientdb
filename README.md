Spring Data OrientDB
====================

The primary goal of the [Spring Data](http://www.springsource.org/spring-data) project is to make it easier to build Spring-powered applications that use new data access technologies such as non-relational databases, map-reduce frameworks, and cloud based data services.

The SpringData OrientDB project will implement easy to use APIs for using OrientDB as a Document database and as a Graph database. 

The document module is based on the [Spring Data MongoDB](https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-data-mongodb) project.
